# Exercise 2: Kotlin OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)
### Create a **_Person_** class:
- Define properties for **_name_**, **_age_**, and **_email_**.
  Create a method to display the personâ€™s details.

### Inheritance:
- Create a class **_Employee_** that inherits from the Person class.
- Add a property for **_salary_**.
- Override the **_displayInfo_** method to include the salary.

### Encapsulation:
- Create a **_BankAccount_** class with a private property **_balance_**. 
- Provide methods to **_deposit_** and **_withdraw_** money, ensuring the balance never goes negative.
